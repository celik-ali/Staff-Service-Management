Gebze Technical University CSE 496 Graduation Project II

Staff Service Management Project focuses on how to make staff service processes easier and safer for drivers and staff. 

How it works and what are the functionalities?

 - Driver needs to add the automation to the group, after that the stations need to be added to the database using service prompts. 

  
  - On the mobile app user will add the group to his profile.

  
  - Staff members notifies the automation about the station they will use then they are registered to that station at the backend.
  
  
  - Later the program takes these processesed information from the database then displays the route on the mobile app easily.
  
  
 - Driver can approve whether the person who are going to use the service, used the service or not.
  
  
  - Driver can easily update services and profile.
